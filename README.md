## Disaster Tweets_NLP_LSTM_LR

*1. Introduction*

* This project aims to classify disaster-related tweets from a given dataset using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and two popular algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

*2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing*

* Data source: The project utilizes a publicly available disaster tweet dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

* Data exploration:

   * pandas is used to explore data characteristics, including missing values and data distribution.
   * Visualization with seaborn provides insights into target distribution and location distribution by disaster type (if applicable).

*3. Feature Engineering*

* Text cleaning:

  * Missing values are handled using appropriate techniques (e.g., filling with a placeholder or deletion).
  * Text normalization, stemming, or lemmatization may be applied to improve consistency and reduce vocabulary size.
  * Removal of stopwords (common words that don't contribute much meaning) can be considered.

* Feature extraction:
  * A common technique like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is employed to convert text into numerical features, capturing the importance of each word relative to the entire corpus.

*4. Model Building and Evaluation*

* 4.1 Logistic Regression Model

   * A baseline model is created using sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.
   * The model is trained on the prepared features and corresponding target labels.
   * Performance is evaluated using accuracy on both the training and test sets.

*4.2 LSTM Model

   * TensorFlow and Keras: The project leverages TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities.

   * Text preprocessing:

Text data is tokenized into sequences of words.

Padding ensures sequences have the same length for model input.

    * Model architecture:

An LSTM layer is included to capture long-range dependencies within text data.

An Embedding layer may be used to represent words as numerical vectors.

A Dense layer with sigmoid activation outputs the probability of a tweet being disaster-related.

    * Training:

The model is trained on a portion of the prepared data using epochs (iterations) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).

A validation split helps monitor generalization and prevent overfitting.

   * Evaluation:

Accuracy and other relevant metrics (e.g., F1-score) are calculated on the held-out test set.

*5. Comparison and Interpretation*

The performance of both models is compared and interpreted.

The LSTM model may potentially outperform the Logistic Regression model due to its ability to learn complex temporal relationships within sequences.

*6. Prediction*

The chosen model (often the best-performing one) is used to predict the disaster category (0 or 1) for unseen tweets.

The predicted labels are saved in a format suitable for submission.

*7. Conclusion*

The project demonstrates the power of NLP and machine learning in classifying disaster-related tweets.

It highlights the potential benefits of using LSTM networks for capturing sequential patterns in text data.

*8. Future Work*

Experimentation: Explore variations in data preprocessing, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve performance.

Ensemble methods: Consider combining predictions from multiple models using techniques like voting or stacking.

Error analysis: Analyze misclassified tweets to understand model limitations and potential areas for improvement.

Real-world application: Integrate the model into a system that can promptly identify and respond to disaster events based on social media data.
